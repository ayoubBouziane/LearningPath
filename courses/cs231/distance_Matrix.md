What is distance Matrix?
A distance matrix is a table that shows the distance between pairs of objects. For example, in the table below we can see a distance of 16 between A and B, of 47 between A and C, and so on. By definition, an objectâ€™s distance from itself,which is shown in the main diagonal of the table, is 0. Distance matrices are sometimes called dissimilarity matrices.

How to create a distance matrix?
a distance matrix is computed from a raw data table. In the example below, we can use high school math (Pythagoras) to work out that the distance between A and B is
 $$\sqrt{(24 - 9)^2 + (54 -  49)^2} \approx 15.81 = 16$$
